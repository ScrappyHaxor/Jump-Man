# Jump-Man Group 28

### INTRODUCTION
  Jump Man is a game based off popular game franchise jump king where the objective is to make it to the top by completing a series of extremely difficult jumps
  You cannot move in the air and you charge your jump by holding down spacebar. This hold down mechanic is sensitive which adds to game difficulty.
  
### ISSUES

### HOW TO PLAY
  Simply clone the repo, open the solution and compile. Repository: https://github.com/ScrappyHaxor/Jump-Man
  Once compiled you can either open the game or the mod tools.
  
  For the game head into JumpMan->Bin->Debug->netcoreapp3.1->JumpMan.exe
  For the mod tools head into ModTools->Bin->Debug->netcoreapp3.1->ModTools.exe
  
  Alternatively if there are issues with compiling, download the latest release (Release.rar) from here https://github.com/ScrappyHaxor/Jump-Man/releases/tag/Final-Build-2
  The Game and Mod Tools are inside of Release.rar in their respective folder.

  For the Level Editor, when you save a level with Control + S, the level will be saved to the same folder as ModTools.exe and if something were to happen, the levels are autosaved regularly inside of the autosaves folder that is in the same folder as ModTools.exe. If you want to open and edit an existing level then simply drag and drop the level file on ModTools.exe and it will open.
